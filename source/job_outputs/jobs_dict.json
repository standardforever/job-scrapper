    "raw_text": "# [1625 Independent People](#)\n \n## Supported Lodgings Host - South Gloucestershire\n \nSupported Lodgings is a fantastic next step for young people who are nearly ready to live fully independently but need a helping hand first.  When someone offers a young person a room, it provides a supportive home environment in which they can learn and grow. Leaving care or a service can be difficult and disorientating – we believe when our young people know what it feels like to belong and be valued, they have the stability to thrive. As a host family, you would play a huge part in supporting a young person to feel valued by providing them with a bedroom for 6-24 months and helping them to feel a part of your household whilst they gain the skills they need to move into their own accommodation. We are looking for people across South Gloucestershire, who have a spare bedroom, to become host families for 16-25 year olds who are studying or working and who need somewhere to stay before moving into independent living. What is Supported Lodgings? The Young Person:\n \n  • Aged 16-25 years old\n  • They are in education, employment or training\n  • Low support needs but may need help learning soft skills like cooking, budgeting, cleaning and shopping\n  • Need compassion and understanding – they have been on a long journey!\n \nThe Host:\n \n  • We encourage a variety of people to apply\n  • We love hosts who are kind and have a passion for young people ​\n  • You can provide a room in your house to be the young person's bedroom\n  • You are not the young person’s only support, we will continue to provide support and social workers, or personal advisors remain involved\n  • You will receive full training to become a host and be supported by our Supported Lodgings Coordinator on every step of your journey\n  • Supported Lodgings is a great first step for people who are considering becoming foster carers. We have supported several hosts to make the move into fostering with relevant training and references\n  • Costs are covered with a £175 per week payment for every week there is a young person in your property\n \nSupported Lodgings is project run by 1625 Independent People in South Gloucestershire.

We believe that working in diverse teams, where everybody’s views are considered and respected, helps us to deliver work of the highest standards of quality and integrity.\n \nOverview/About the Role\n \nCompass Lexecon is recruiting Data Scientists with hands on experience in data engineering workflows to join the Data team part of the broader Research Team. Data is a core part of every project at Compass Lexecon and turning that data into compelling empirical analysis is fundamental to what we do. With increasing amounts of data being generated, there are exciting opportunities to apply tools from data science, machine learning, and data engineering to the interesting policy and competition questions that arise in our work.\n \nThe team aims to (a) advance our thought leadership in the industry by introducing new tools and techniques to address challenges encountered in economic consulting, bringing Compass Lexecon to the forefront of data analytics, and (b) broaden and deepen all Compass Lexecon economists’ specialist skillsets to offer our clients the most effective, creative and cutting-edge analysis and advice. In doing so, we aim to push the frontier of how data is used to shape markets in some of the world’s most important industries.\n \n### Key Responsibilities:\n \n\n  • Work on client-facing projects, designing and implementing complex data science solutions, from concept to productions to solve real-world competition and regulatory challenges faced by businesses. Each project is different - one week, you might solve a data engineering challenge, which could involve mining large datasets. The next week, you may find yourself working on natural language processing using large language models, developing innovative AI applications.\n  • Contribute to cutting-edge research projects, advancing Compass Lexecon’s thought leadership in the application of advanced analytics to competition and finance cases.\n  • Conduct advanced training sessions and develop sophisticated tools to enhance how economists work with data.\n \n### Qualifications and Experience Required:\n \n\n  • Master’s degree in data science, computer science, applied mathematics, statistics, machine learning, economics, or operations research.\n  • At least 2 years of professional data science experience, with a proven track record of translating business problems into data science solutions.\n  • Proficiency in Python, R, and SQL, with experience developing production-level code and working effectively with relevant libraries and frameworks, as well as hands-on proficiency with NoSQL databases such as MongoDB.\n  • Possess practical experience with a range of data science methods and concepts, such as data engineering workflows, machine learning, natural language processing, with the ability to quickly learn new tools as needed.\n  • Hands-on experience with cloud computing platforms (Azure, AWS, or GCP) and container technologies (such as Docker) in collaborative project environments.\n  • Solid understanding of data engineering principles including data modelling, ETL processes, and building data pipelines.\n  • Strong organizational skills, able to independently manage multiple projects and deliverables on time.\n  • Excellent teamwork and communication skills, with demonstrated ability to share knowledge and present findings clearly to both technical and non-technical colleagues.\n \nWe may use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to support parts of the hiring process, such as reviewing applications, analyzing resumes, or assessing responses. These tools assist our recruitment team but do not replace human judgment. Final hiring decisions are ultimately made by humans.
